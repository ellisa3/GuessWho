GUESS WHO

Our program is the game Guess Who. It opens two windows: one that shows the characters and another that shows the questions. Our game is split into two 
halves. In the first half, the user chooses a character from the window and answers the yes or no questions posed by the computer in the terminal. After 
the computer has guessed the user’s character, the second half of the game begins. The computer chooses a character, and the user must guess who it is. The 
computer prompts the user in the terminal to either ask a question by typing the question number or to guess the character directly by typing in his/her 
name. After the user asks a question, the computer will print a response and black out the incorrect characters in characters window. After the user has 
guessed the computer’s character, the computer will print the results of the two halves. Whoever had fewer guesses wins the game.

Our program is made up of functions whose roles are explained in the code. Our data are stored in lists. Currently, all the functions explained above work 
successfully. 

The game is played in the terminal, and instructions are given through the prompts. Have fun  :)
